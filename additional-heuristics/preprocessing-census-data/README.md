Preprocessing of the census data can be obtained from an open source code at https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/collaboration-space/browse/all-contributions. 
The code was developed by the team DP_WGAN-UCLANESL for Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge, hosted by NIST. 

We also include the splitting of census data into 16 groups by 2 genders and 8 education levels.
