This folder contains the Multiplicative Weight Update (MW) and Frank-Wolfe algorithms for solving SDP relaxation of multi-criteria dimensionality reduction.

The simplest way to start is to download this whole folder (which is executable by itself). If mat folder is too big, you may download only the 16 of those 'n=1000' files. Go to 'heuristics' file, and start running the code. There, you will see an example of using MW and FW on three fairness objectives MM_Var, MM_Loss, and NSW. 

Once you understand the syntax, you can replace the data matrices (which is now loaded by the 'heuristics' file from the 'mat' folder) by the data matrices of interests.
